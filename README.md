# Introducing Recolon

Recolon is an experimental programming language project developed in Rust. It currently supports fundamental operations such as calculations, conditional statements, variable declarations, and logging. This project represents my take on the simplest approach to coding efficiently.

## Features
- Conditional Statements: if-else logic for control flow.
- Variables: Declaration and use of variables.
- Logging Functions: Output messages and errors with log and err.
- Arithmetic Operators: ```+, -, *, /``` for basic math operations.
- Comparison Operators: ```==, !=, >, <, >=, <=``` for comparisons.
- Logical Operators: ```and / or```

## Usage
Write Recolon programs in files with a .rcn extension and execute them using the Recolon interpreter (once available).

### Syntax
```
if (x == y) {
  log("This is a log message");
} else {
  err("This is an error message");
}
```
