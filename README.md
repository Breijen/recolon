# Welcome to Recolon

Recolon is a simple, experimental language project built with Rust. It currently supports basic operations like calculations, conditional statements, variable declarations, and logging.

## Features
- Conditional Statements: if-else logic for control flow.
- Variables: Declaration and use of variables.
- Logging Functions: Output messages and errors with log and err.
- Arithmetic Operators: ```+, -, *, /``` for basic math operations.
- Comparison Operators: ```==, !=, >, <, >=, <=``` for comparisons.

## Usage
Write Recolon programs in files with a .rcn extension and execute them using the Recolon interpreter (once available).

### Syntax
```
if (x == y) {
  log("This is a log message");
} else {
  err("This is an error message");
}
```
